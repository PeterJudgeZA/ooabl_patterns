# ooabl_patterns
Sample code for OOABL Design Patterns talks given at the 2017 [EMEA PUG Challenge](https://pugchallenge.eu/). The presentation is in this project ion PDF form: advanced_ooabl_patterns.pdf . 

You will need a version of the Sports2000 database. Create one via `proenv` and `prodb path/to/project/sports2000 sports2000` (or wherever you choose).

Import the project into PDSOE. It should be all set up, and compile. The ./dlc-src folder contains code that's available in `$DLC/src/OpenEdge.Core.pl` ; it's been extracted here for ease-of-use.

To test, run the `src/runner.p` procedure. Note that this code is a sample and for illustrative purposes - there are a bunch of assumptions baked into the code.
